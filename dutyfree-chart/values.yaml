## configuration for the service that runs on top of the main deployment in
## the current config we have it as a NodePort since we have an ingress on top
## of it that routes the connections to it. it can also be created as a type:
## LoadBalancer with an ip to be directly accessible from outside.
service:
  ## currently either NodePort or LoadBalancer
  type: NodePort
  port: 80
  ##uncomment the below in case of using a LoadBalancer
  # LoadBalancerIp: 1.2.3.4

## in case of relaying the tls termination to GKE this should be set to
## enabled. This allows the manifest to create a signed certificate to be used
## by the ingress.
certificate:
  enabled: true
  name: dutyfree-certificate
  ## domain to sign the certificate with.
  domain: resource-types.concourse-ci.org

## Enable this in case you want to route connections to the service through an ingress.
## currently, this is more opinionated towards the GCP Ingress and not the
## nginx. GCP doesn't currently support http to https redirection, so we added
## an option to just disable http until this feature becomes available.
